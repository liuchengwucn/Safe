Given a solution to a problem, you need to break down the solution into individual logical stepsã€‚
You have to answer the question in JSON format.
The answer must be an Array, where each element is a string representing a logically independent step.
You can only split the answer simply, and you cannot make any modifications to the answer, even if the answer is incorrect.
You must include the complete solution without any missing steps.
Here are some examples.

### Solution:
I want to find the smallest positive integer $X$ that satisfies the given conditions. I know that any multiple of 3 has the form $3k$ for some integer $k$, so $X$ has the form $3k + 2$. I also know that any multiple of 5 has the form $5n$ for some integer $n$, so the number with the same units digit as $X$ has the form $5n + 4$. Since the units digits of $X$ and $5n + 4$ are the same, I can equate them and get $3k + 2 \equiv 5n + 4 \pmod{10}$. This means that the difference between $3k + 2$ and $5n + 4$ is a multiple of 10. I can simplify this difference by subtracting 4 from both sides and get $3k - 2 \equiv 5n \pmod{10}$. Now I need to find the smallest values of $k$ and $n$ that make this equation true. I can try some values of $k$ and see what they imply for $n$. If $k = 0$, then $3k - 2 = -2$ and $5n = -2 + 10m$ for some integer $m$. This implies that $n = -0.4 + 2m$, which is not an integer. So $k = 0$ does not work. If $k = 1$, then $3k - 2 = 1$ and $5n = 1 + 10m$ for some integer $m$. This implies that $n = 0.2 + 2m$, which is also not an integer. So $k = 1$ does not work either. If $k = 2$, then $3k - 2 = 4$ and $5n = 4 + 10m$ for some integer $m$. This implies that $n = 0.8 + 2m$, which is again not an integer. So $k = 2$ does not work as well. If $k = 3$, then $3k - 2 = 7$ and $5n = 7 + 10m$ for some integer $m$. This implies that $n = 1.4 + 2m$, which is not an integer. So $k = 3$ does not work. If $k = 4$, then $3k - 2 = 10$ and $5n = 10 + 10m$ for some integer $m$. This implies that $n = 2 + 2m$, which is an integer. So $k = 4$ works. This means that the smallest value of $X$ is $3k + 2 = 3 \cdot 4 + 2 = 14$.

### Solution:
I want to find the value of $m$ that makes the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ have integer solutions. One way to do this is to use the quadratic formula, which says that the solutions are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 10$, $b = -m$, and $c = 420$. In order for the solutions to be integers, the expression under the square root, $b^2 - 4ac$, must be a perfect square. So I need to find the smallest positive value of $m$ that makes $b^2 - 4ac$ a perfect square. I can try some values of $m$ and see what happens. If $m = 1$, then $b^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4(10)(420) = 1 - 16800 = -16799$, which is not a perfect square. If $m = 2$, then $b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(10)(420) = 4 - 16800 = -16796$, which is also not a perfect square. I notice that $b^2 - 4ac$ is decreasing as $m$ increases, so I want to find the smallest $m$ that makes $b^2 - 4ac$ nonnegative. I can use some algebra to find this value. I need to have $b^2 - 4ac \geq 0$, or $m^2 - 16800 \geq 0$. This means that $m^2 \geq 16800$, or $m \geq \sqrt{16800}$. I can use a calculator to find that $\sqrt{16800} \approx 129.61$. Since $m$ has to be a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $m$ that satisfies this inequality is $m = 130$. I can check if this value of $m$ makes $b^2 - 4ac$ a perfect square. If $m = 130$, then $b^2 - 4ac = (-130)^2 - 4(10)(420) = 16900 - 16800 = 100$, which is a perfect square. So $m = 130$ is the smallest positive value of $m$ that makes the equation $10x^2 - mx + 420 = 0$ have integral solutions.

### Solution:
This problem involves finding the maximum value of an expression involving square roots and inequalities. I wonder if there is a way to simplify the expression or rewrite it in a more convenient form. I notice that the expression is symmetric in $a$ and $b,$ so it might help to use the fact that $a + b = 16$ to eliminate one of them. For example, I can rewrite the expression as $\sqrt{c(b - c)} + \sqrt{c(16 - b - c)}.$ Now I only have two variables to deal with, $b$ and $c.$ However, I still have the constraint that $a \ge b \ge c \ge 0,$ which implies that $16 - b \ge b \ge c \ge 0.$ This means that both terms inside the square roots are nonnegative, which is good. I wonder if there is a way to apply some inequality to the expression to get an upper bound. I recall that the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for any nonnegative numbers $x$ and $y,$ we have $\frac{x + y}{2} \ge \sqrt{xy}.$ This inequality is useful for finding upper bounds for products of nonnegative numbers. I also notice that the expression I want to maximize is the sum of two square roots of products of nonnegative numbers. Maybe I can apply the AM-GM inequality to each term separately and then add them up. Let me try that. By AM-GM, I have $\sqrt{c(b - c)} \le \frac{c + (b - c)}{2} = \frac{b}{2}$ and $\sqrt{c(16 - b - c)} \le \frac{c + (16 - b - c)}{2} = \frac{16 - b}{2}.$ Adding these two inequalities, I get $\sqrt{c(b - c)} + \sqrt{c(16 - b - c)} \le \frac{b}{2} + \frac{16 - b}{2} = 8.$ This means that the maximum possible value of the expression is at most 8. But is 8 actually achievable? To check that, I need to find values of $b$ and $c$ that satisfy the original constraints and make both inequalities become equalities. For the first inequality to be an equality, I need $c = b - c,$ or $2c = b.$ For the second inequality to be an equality, I need $c = 16 - b - c,$ or $2c = 16 - b.$ Combining these two equations, I get $b = 8.$ Then, plugging in $b = 8$ into either equation, I get $c = 4.$ These values of $b$ and $c$ satisfy the original constraints, since $16 - b \ge b \ge c \ge 0.$
